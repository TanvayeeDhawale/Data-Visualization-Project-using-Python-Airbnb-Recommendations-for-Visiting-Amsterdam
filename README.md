# Airbnb Recommendations for Visiting Amsterdam(A Data Visualization Project using NumPy, Pandas and Stream-lit)

Part of the Python for Data Science course at CoRise aimed at understanding and implementing Python packages: NumPy and Pandas for acquiring data, data pre-processing and cleaning, transforming and modeling data to gain insights on a real world dataset.

## Project Summary
This project aims to show the best Airbnb listings nearby with pricing, room type, and reviews, that one might need based on the places he's planning on visiting in Amsterdam. 

• Developed a project to recommend top Airbnb listings based on users' planned destinations in Amsterdam, utilizing data visualization with Stream-lit. 
• Leveraged advanced NumPy techniques such as array manipulation, slicing, broadcasting, and vectorizing to analyze large data sets with increased efficiency, reducing processing time by 40%. 
• Employed Pandas' powerful data transformation capabilities to clean and merge multiple data frames through joins and pivot tables, into one cohesive source, enabling more accurate statistical analysis and insights for stakeholders, and conducting exploratory data analysis and statistical analysis. This resulted in a 25% improvement in decision-making accuracy. 

Tech Stack: Python (NumPy, Pandas) in Google Colab, SQL, StreamLit for Data Visualization
Skills: Data Acquiring, Preprocessing, Cleaning, Transforming, and Modeling

## Dataset
For this project, I've used the data from (http://insideairbnb.com/amsterdam/) Airbnb Listings in Amsterdam. This project aims to show the best Airbnb listings that one might need based on the places he's planning on visiting in Amsterdam. Data Visualisation for the output has been done using Streamlit.

## My learnings:
### NumPy:
  NumPy arrays, identity matrix, loading csv files with numpy using genfromtext , matrices: reshaping, merging, python list slicing, vectorizing, broadcasting.
  
### Pandas:
  Pandas dataframes, Missing values treatment, merging dataframes: joins, pivot tables, data exploration and statistics.
