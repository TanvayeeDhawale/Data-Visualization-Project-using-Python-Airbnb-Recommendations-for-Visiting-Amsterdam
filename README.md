# Python-For-Data-Science-with-Corise-Projects

Python for Data Science is a two week course I took on the platform- Corise. 
Over the course of 2 weeks, I learnt and implemented the two fundamental packages in Python - NumPy and Pandas.

My goals for the course were:
  1. To understand data science fundamentals: acquiring data, data pre-processing and cleaning, transforming and modeling data to gain insights.
  2. Implementing an end-to-end data analysis on a real world dataset.

# The Data
For this project, I've used the data from (http://insideairbnb.com/amsterdam/) Airbnb Listings in Amsterdam. This project aims to show the best Airbnb listings that one might need based on the places he's planning on visiting in Amsterdam. Data Visualisation for the output has been done using Streamlit.
